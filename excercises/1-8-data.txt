We are the hollow men 
we are the stuffed men
leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
Our dried voices, when
  We whisper together
Are quire and meaningless
As wind inn dry grass
  or rats' feet over broken glass
In our dry celler

Shape without form, shade without colour,
Paralysed force, gesture without motion;

Those who have corssed
  With direct eyes, to death's other kingdom
Remember us - if at all - not as lost
  violent souls, but only
  as the hollow men
The stuffed men.

Eyes I dare not meet in dreams
In death's dream kingdom
Those do not appera:
There, the eyes are
Sunlight no a broken column
There is a tree swinging
And voices are
  In the wind's singing
More distant and more solemn
  than a fading star.

Let me be no nearer
In death's dream kingdom
Let me also wear
  Such deliberate disguises
Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves
  In a field
Behaving as the wind behaves
 No nearer

Not that final meeting 
In the twilight kingdom
